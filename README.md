# hello-world
James' hello-world repository

This is a test of my GitHub account.  I've created a new README-edit branch following GitHub's hello world excerise.  I can tell GitHub is siginificantly more powerful and flexible than Microsoft Visual Source Safe or TFS.

Apparently GitHub thinks moon tacos are better than earth tacos.  I respectfully disagree.

Cheers!
